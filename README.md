# OCB Electricity Light Fixes Modlet - 7 Days to Die ElectricityLamps Addon

Needs https://github.com/OCB7D2D/ElectricityLamps to do anything useful!  
In the future I might create a standalone version for original Lights!

This Mod optimizes POI lights to try to get better lighting. It does this
by resetting certain light properties, like changing some lights from point
to spotlights, re-orienting where the light shines and most importantly
adjusting some shadow settings, like shadow near plane and bias. This
fixes some instances of light shining through walls where it should not.

Unfortunately this introduces some issues on its own, although I tried to
keep them to a minimum. Sometimes the spotlights don't light the ceiling
as it should be, but I sometimes had to still use it since it fixed other
more obvious issues. It's an ongoing optimization where a lot of tradeoffs
have to be taken into account.
